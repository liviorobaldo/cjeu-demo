            <p>It is necessary, second, to interpret a harmonised standard in the light of the mandate from which it originates. In accordance with Article 17(1) of Regulation No 305/2011, harmonised standards are to be established by the European standardisation bodies listed in Annex I to Directive 98/34 on the basis of requests issued by the Commission.

            <p>Where, therefore, a harmonised standard does not indicate expressly that it is intended to replace another harmonised standard or one or more European technical assessments, those harmonised technical specifications remain in force and constitute special derogating rules. In accordance with Article 19(1) of Regulation No 305/2011, a European assessment document may be adopted only for a construction product not covered or not fully covered by a harmonised standard, for which the performance in relation to its essential characteristics cannot be entirely assessed according to an existing harmonised standard.</p>

            <p>That interpretation of Article 19(1) of Regulation No 305/2011 is, moreover, borne out by Article 21(1)(a) of the regulation, under which, where a TAB receives a request for a European technical assessment concerning a product fully covered by a harmonised standard, the TAB must inform the manufacturer that, in accordance with Article 19(1), a European technical assessment cannot be issued.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, while European assessment documents within the meaning of Article 19(1) of Regulation No 305/2011, like European technical assessments within the meaning of Article 8 of Directive 89/106 which that regulation repealed, can indeed be drawn up only for construction products that are, wholly or partly, not covered by a harmonised standard, the fact remains that, as stated in paragraph 32 above, the interpretation of those standards is finally a matter for the Court, not for the authors of such documents or assessments. Consequently, when the Court has to interpret a harmonised standard, it can take account, as one factor among others, of the existence of a European assessment document or a European technical assessment as an indication that the products covered by it, and similar products, are not covered by any harmonised standard, but without such a factor being determinative or preventing the Court, if appropriate, from arriving at an interpretation of the harmonised standard in question that differs from that adopted by the author of the document or assessment.</p>

            <p>Fourth, as regards guidelines published by national or international standardisation bodies, it must be noted that, even if such documents are intended to explain the scope of the harmonised standards whose references are published by the Commission, the fact remains that they cannot constitute legally binding instruments in the EU legal order. It follows that those documents are of no relevance for the interpretation of a harmonised standard, nor do they bind the national courts, even though they may be a useful guide for the implementation of the standard.</p>
