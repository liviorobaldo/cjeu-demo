In particular, the referring court points out that there is no need for regulation to ensure that the markets on which the applicants in the main proceedings operate function properly.

          In that regard, it should be recalled, first, that under Article 9(1) of Directive 97/67, Member States may make undertakings active in the postal sector subject to general authorisations with regard to services which fall outside the scope of the universal service, while the first subparagraph of Article 9(2) of that directive provides that Member States may introduce authorisation procedures with regard to services which fall within the scope of the universal service (judgment of 16 November 2016, DHL Express (Austria),

          Next, the second subparagraph of Article 9(2) of Directive 97/67 lists the obligations to which the granting of authorisations may be made subject, although it is not possible to infer from the wording of that provision which category of authorisations that subparagraph is referring to: whether authorisations relating to all postal services or those which concern only services falling within the scope of the universal service (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 November 2016, DHL Express (Austria),

          In that regard, it should be noted, first, that it is clear from an analysis of the overall structure of the second subparagraph of Article 9(2) Directive 97/67 that the term ‘authorisations’, as used in that provision, applies both to the authorisations referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 9(2) and to the authorisations referred to in Article 9(1) of that directive (judgment of 16 November 2016, DHL Express (Austria),
