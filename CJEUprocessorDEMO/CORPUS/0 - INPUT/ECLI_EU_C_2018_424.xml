In subparagraphs (2) to (7) real property is equated with permanent establishments. “Ultimate parent company” shall be understood to mean that company which is the parent company without being a subsidiary: see Paragraph 31C.</p>
        <p class="normal">(2)   For jointly taxed companies a joint income statement shall be established, consisting in the sum of the taxable income for each individual company covered by the joint taxation, calculated according to the general rules of the tax legislation, with those exceptions applicable to jointly taxed companies. Losses in a permanent establishment may be offset against other companies’ income only if under the rules in the foreign State, on the Faroe Islands or in Greenland, where the company is resident, losses cannot be included in the calculation of the company’s income statement in that foreign State, on the Faroe Islands or in Greenland, where the company is resident, or if international joint taxation has been chosen under Paragraph 31A. The joint taxation income shall be calculated after offset has been made for each individual company for losses from earlier income periods that can be carried forward. If the joint taxation income is positive, the profit shall be distributed proportionately between the profit-making companies. If the joint taxation income for a fiscal year is negative, the losses shall be distributed proportionately between the loss-making companies and carried forward in the relevant company for offset the following subsequent fiscal year. Losses in a company relating to joint taxation periods can be offset only against profits in that same company. In carrying forward losses, the oldest losses are offset first. Losses in a company relating to earlier fiscal years can be offset against profits in another company only if the losses occurred in a fiscal year in which the relevant companies were taxed jointly and the joint taxation has not subsequently been interrupted.</p>
        <p class="normal">…</p>
        <p class="normal">(4)   In national joint taxation the top parent company taking part in the joint taxation shall be designated as the management company for the purposes of joint taxation. If there is no Danish taxable top parent company, but a number of horizontally linked Danish taxable affiliated companies, one the affiliated companies taking part in the joint taxation shall be designated as the management company. … The management company shall be responsible for payment of the overall income tax. …</p>
        <p class="normal">(5)   All companies in the joint taxation shall calculate the taxable income for the same period as the management company, irrespective of the accounting year under company law rules: see Paragraph 10(5).</p>
        <p class="normal">…</p>
        <p class="normal">(7)   In the calculation of the taxable income, a jointly taxed company may opt to ignore losses, including losses carried forward from earlier fiscal years. Losses corresponding to the taxable income in a jointly taxed permanent establishment in Denmark or a jointly taxed subsidiary in Denmark may be ignored when the permanent establishment’s or subsidiary’s income is included in the income statement outside Denmark, provided that the relevant State’s relief for the Danish taxation corresponds to the relief method provided for in Paragraph 33 of the Law on tax assessment (Ligningsloven). The amount ignored shall instead be carried forward to subsequent fiscal years in accordance with the rules in Paragraph 15 of the Law on tax assessment. If an amount lower than the overall losses is ignored, that amount shall be distributed proportionately to the individual loss-making sources.’</p>

          When the tax authorities’ refusal was confirmed by a decision of the Landsskatteretten (National Tax Appeals Commission) of 20 January 2014, Bevola and Jens W. Trock challenged that decision before the Østre Landsret (High Court of Eastern Denmark, Denmark). They argue that it would have been possible for Bevola to deduct the losses in question if they had been incurred by a Danish establishment, and that that difference in treatment constitutes a restriction of freedom of establishment within the meaning of Article 49 TFEU. The restriction, they submit, goes beyond what is necessary for maintaining the balanced allocation of powers of taxation between the Member States in a case such as Bevola’s where there is no possibility of taking the losses of its Finnish establishment into account. They submit that the findings of the Court in the judgment of 13 December 2005, Marks &amp;amp; Spencer (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2005%3A763&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑446/03</a>

          ), may be applied to Bevola’s situation, namely that it is contrary to EU law to exclude the possibility for a resident parent company of deducting losses incurred by its non-resident subsidiary where the subsidiary has exhausted the possibilities of having those losses taken into account in its State of establishment.

          As the Court has previously held, a provision which allows losses incurred by a permanent establishment to be taken into account in calculating the taxable profits of the company to which the establishment belongs constitutes a tax advantage (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 May 2008, Lidl Belgium,

          Granting such an advantage where the losses are incurred by a permanent establishment situated in the Member State of the resident company, but not where the losses are incurred by a permanent establishment in a Member State other than that of the resident company, has the consequence that the tax situation of a resident company possessing a permanent establishment in another Member State is less favourable than it would be if the permanent establishment were in the same Member State as the resident company. By reason of that difference in treatment, a resident company could be discouraged from carrying on its business through a permanent establishment situated in another Member State (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 May 2008, Lidl Belgium,

          ), cannot be understood, however, as meaning that, where national tax legislation treats two situations differently, they cannot be regarded as comparable. The Court held that the application of different tax rules to a resident company depending on whether it has a resident permanent establishment or a non-resident permanent establishment cannot be a valid criterion for assessing the objective comparability of the situations (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 January 2009, STEKO Industriemontage,

          ). Moreover, to accept that a Member State may in all cases apply different treatment solely because the permanent establishment of a resident company is situated in another Member State would deprive Article 49 TFEU of its substance (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 February 2010, X Holding,

          It should be stressed that, if a resident company were free to define the extent to which that joint taxation was applied, it would be able to decide at will to incorporate only non-resident permanent establishments facing losses, which would then be deducted from its taxable income in Denmark, while excluding establishments making profits and subject in their own Member State to a rate of tax that might be more favourable than in Denmark. Similarly, the possibility which would be left to the resident company of altering the extent of international joint taxation from one year to the next would be tantamount to allowing it to choose freely the Member State in which the losses of the non-resident permanent establishment in question were to be taken into account (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 February 2010, X Holding,
