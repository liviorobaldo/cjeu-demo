The Portuguese language version of the second sentence of the third subparagraph of Article 21(5) of that directive provides, on the other hand, that Member States may exempt ‘estes pequenos produtores’, an expression which may be translated as ‘these small producers’. However, other language versions of Directive 2003/96, such as the German, English or French language versions, do not refer to ‘

          It follows that the use by an entity, such as the one in question in the main proceedings, of a portion of the electricity that it produces for the purpose of generating electricity, whilst constituting a chargeable event for tax under the first and third subparagraphs of Article 21(5) of Directive 2003/96, must be exempted from tax under Article 14(1)(a) of that directive. Any other interpretation would undermine the objectives pursued by that directive, as referred to in paragraphs 34 and 35 of this judgment. First, the electricity thus produced would necessarily be subject to double taxation. Secondly, it could lead to unequal treatment between entities such as the one in question in the main proceedings and other electricity producers using energy products and electricity supplied by third parties for the purpose of their own production, which would be a source of distortions of competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 March 2018, Cristal Union,

          It must be pointed out, however, that Directive 2003/96 does not govern how proof that energy products have been used for purposes giving rise to a right to exemption is to be adduced. On the contrary, as is clear from Article 14(1) thereof, Directive 2003/96 gives the Member States responsibility for laying down the conditions for the exemptions referred to in that provision, in order to ensure the correct and straightforward application of such exemptions and to prevent any evasion, avoidance or abuse. The fact remains that the Member States, when exercising their power to lay down the conditions to which the exemptions provided for in Article 14(1) of the directive are subject, must observe the general principles of law which form part of the legal order of the European Union, including, inter alia, the principle of proportionality (judgment of 2 June 2016, Polihim-SS,
