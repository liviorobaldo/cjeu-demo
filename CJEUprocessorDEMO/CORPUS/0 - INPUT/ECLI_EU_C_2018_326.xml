          ). However, having regard to the fact that the repeal took effect from 14 June 2011 and the facts at issue in the main proceedings arose before that date, it is therefore necessary to have regard to Directive 91/414, as amended by Directive 2010/28. The fifth to seventh and ninth recitals of Directive 91/414 stated:
        </p>
        <p class="normal">‘Whereas, in view of the hazards, there are rules in most Member States governing the authorisation of plant health products; whereas these rules present differences which constitute barriers not only to trade in plant protection products but also to trade in plant products, and thereby directly affect the establishment and operation of the internal market;</p>
        <p class="normal">Whereas it is therefore desirable to eliminate such barriers by harmonising the provisions laid down in the Member States;</p>
        <p class="normal">Whereas uniform rules on the conditions and procedures for the authorisation of plant protection products must be applied by the Member States;</p>
        <p class="normal">…</p>
        <p class="normal">Whereas the provisions governing authorisation must ensure a high standard of protection, which, in particular, must prevent the authorisation of plant protection products whose risks to health, groundwater and the environment [have not been researched properly]; … human and animal health should take priority over the objective of improving plant production’.</p>

          That conclusion is not called into question by the judgment of 18 July 2007, Industrias Químicas del Vallés v Commission (

          ). In that regard, it must be recalled, first, as the Advocate General observed in paragraph 80 of his opinion, that the case that gave rise to that judgment concerned a time limit set by the Commission in the context of the procedure for the inclusion of metalaxyl in Annex I to Directive 91/414 and the possibility for that institution, and not for the Member States, of changing that time limit. By contrast, the case in the main proceedings, which concerns the procedure of re-evaluation by the Member States of existing marketing authorisations for plant protection products containing metalaxyl, raises the question of whether, as regards a time limit set by the Commission and included in the provisions of a Directive, Member States may, unilaterally, extend that time limit.

          ), the Court relied on the fact that the party concerned had been placed in a position that made it impossible for it to submit a complete dossier within the time limit owing partly to the contradictory conduct of the competent authorities, including the Commission. It is clear from the order for reference that, contrary the situation that arose in the case that gave rise to that judgment, Sapec Agro was not, in the present case, affected by that kind of circumstance beyond its control. On the contrary, the obligation to possess, or have access to, within the prescribed time limit, a dossier that met the requirements laid down in Annex II to Directive 91/414 was clearly established from the beginning of the procedure, since it was provided for in Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28.
