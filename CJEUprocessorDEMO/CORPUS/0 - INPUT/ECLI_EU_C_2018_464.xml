First, that provision is designed to give general protection to all information the confidentiality of which the supervised entity or a third party have a legitimate interest in maintaining, including information that has an economic value that can be realised in the course of insolvency proceedings, irrespective of whether the information strictly concerns trade or business secrets. Second, that provision also provides protection against the disclosure of information the confidentiality of which the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority has a legitimate interest in maintaining. In all cases, it is necessary to examine the content of the information in order to decide whether there is such a legitimate interest. Further, the extent to which information merits protection should generally diminish over time.</p>
