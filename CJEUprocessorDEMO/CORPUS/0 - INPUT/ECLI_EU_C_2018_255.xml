First, those complaints unjustifiably extend the scope of the complaints set out in the reasoned opinion, since the latter complaints refer only to the consequences of the adoption of the 2016 appendix, which relates to the Białowieża Forest District. Thus, the subject matter of the dispute is extended

The events in respect of which the Republic of Poland is criticised in the reasoned opinion concern only the Białowieża Forest District for the sole reason that the measures adopted by the Polish authorities, as at the date of that opinion, concerned solely that district. However, the same measures have also been adopted by the Republic of Poland for the other two forest districts forming part of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site. As identical events constituting the same conduct are involved, the action for failure to fulfil obligations justifiably relates to the entire territory covered by the active forest management operations concerned on the date when the case was brought before the Court. The fact that the geographical scope was extended between the reasoned opinion and the action for failure to fulfil obligations is solely a consequence of the Polish authorities’ own choice to adopt decisions of the same nature in the course of the pre-litigation procedure and to make them public belatedly.</p>

Unlike the 2015 PZO, the 2012 FMP is not a ‘management plan’ within the meaning of Article 6(1) of the Habitats Directive because it does not lay down the objectives and the necessary conservation measures for Natura 2000 sites. The main purpose of the 2012 FMP is to regulate forest management practices, in particular by setting the maximum volume of timber which can be extracted and by establishing forest protection measures. It was therefore necessary, before adopting or amending it, to carry out an appropriate assessment of its implications for the Natura 2000 site concerned in the light of the conservation objectives of that site, in accordance with Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive.</p>

Moreover, they are not monitored at all within the Białowieża National Park, where the conservation status of the habitats is better than in the forest districts managed by the State Forest Office, in which ‘sanitary pruning/felling’ has been carried out. Scientific studies also attest to the better conservation status of Białowieża Forest habitats which are excluded from all human intervention. Also, scientists fear that the removal of dead or dying trees disrupts the age structure balance of the forest stands, impoverishes the diversity of protected species and habitats, and eliminates important food sources for many protected animal species. The removal of dead wood within the framework of ‘sanitary pruning/felling’ is therefore incompatible with the conservation objectives of the protected areas, since retention of the dead wood in the forest is necessary to preserve biodiversity.</p>

In actual fact, since the designation of such areas did not affect the maximum total volume of timber extraction set in the 2016 appendix, the establishment of those areas results in an intensification of felling in the rest of the Białowieża Forest District.

Such a plan is in fact a technical tool necessary to implement the conservation measures provided for in the 2015 PZO, since the latter does not set a volume for timber extraction. In particular, the 2016 appendix enables the conservation objective of limiting the spread of the spruce bark beetle to be achieved. In this connection, it should be noted that the level of timber harvesting referred to in that appendix, namely 188000 m

          Next, the Republic of Poland states that it was considered likely that implementation of the 2016 appendix could have a potential impact on the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site. It was for that very reason that it was considered necessary to carry out the 2015 impact assessment. In this instance, following that assessment an initial draft of the appendix, increasing the volume of timber harvesting to 317894 m
          <span class="super">3</span>
          , received a negative opinion. Taking that assessment into account, the 2016 appendix reduced timber harvesting by 129000 m
          <span class="super">3</span>
          . The fresh assessment relating to that appendix showed that there was no likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the integrity of the site. In actual fact, the appendix has a significant positive impact on the elements protected in the 2015 PZO. Indeed, the change in the harvesting volume is essential for implementing the conservation measures provided for in the 2015 PZO. Furthermore, the 2016 appendix does not provide for the deliberate killing, capture or disturbance of animals.

In particular, the state and percentage coverage of the habitats and species present when that site was designated are the result of the previous harvesting of the Białowieża Forest, that is to say, the extraction of timber from forest stands planted in the past. In fact, it is the drastic reduction, under pressure from the Commission, of logging in ageing forest stands in the 2012 FMP which led to a die-back of forest stands, in particular of spruce trees, on account of the resulting spread of the spruce bark beetle. Following that die-back, the protected habitats began to undergo changes. In particular, habitat 9170 (sub-continental oak-hornbeam forests), that is to say, the dominant habitat, started to be converted into bogs or meadows. The Polish authorities therefore drew up the remediation programme having as its starting point an overall survey of the state of the habitats and species of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site. In that context, the adoption of the 2016 appendix is an attempt to return to the former method of management.</p>

It is generally recommended that land on which natural processes are protected, such as national parks, be clearly divided into an intervention-free area and peripheral areas, in which operations to limit the spread of the spruce bark beetle will be carried out.

In those stands, only ‘sanitary pruning/felling’ takes place, in order to eliminate spruce wood colonised by the spruce bark beetle. Dry wood is not removed. In addition, no ‘sanitary pruning/felling’ is carried out in nature reserves and in boggy and wet habitats. The areas which are not covered by ‘sanitary pruning/felling’ thus represent 7123 hectares, that is to say, 58% of the surface area of the Białowieża Forest District. Furthermore, the operations provided for in the 2016 appendix concern only 5.4% of the surface area of the site at issue, that is to say, 3401 hectares.

Those areas are in no way intended to offset or mitigate the allegedly negative impact of the active forest management operations at issue. They were established in accordance with the principle of sincere cooperation, referred to in Article 4(3) TEU, for the purpose of comparison with other areas of the Białowieża Forest. Moreover, their location is linked to the conservation status of the natural habitats and the absence of any necessity to carry out conservation tasks arising from the 2015 PZO. Nor can the Commission criticise the Polish authorities for having failed to carry out an environmental impact assessment in relation to the reference areas. If such reasoning were followed, the same criticism should be made concerning the interruption of logging throughout the Białowieża Forest sought by the Commission.</p>

          In that regard, the Commission is mistaken in its view that inaction has a positive impact on biodiversity. Thus, the results of the survey carried out since April 2016 show that, for example, in the strict protection area of the Białowieża National Park only one colony of
          <span class="italic">Boros schneideri</span>
          is present, while in the Białowieża Forest District the presence of 70 such colonies has been observed. A similar situation exists for a whole series of other species, such as, in particular, the pygmy owl and the three-toed woodpecker.

Whilst part of the scientific community is opposed to dealing with the spread of the spruce bark beetle by the felling of colonised trees, there is also a series of scientific works according to which the absence of a response to the spruce bark beetle in the Białowieża Forest gives rise specifically to a high probability of serious and irreparable harm for the natural habitats and habitats of the animal species for the conservation of which the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site was designated. In addition, according to a study concerning the Białowieża Forest, strict protection should be only a supplement to and not the main element of the strategy for conserving and maintaining a high level of biodiversity.</p>

As the Republic of Poland confirmed at the hearing in reply to a question from the Court in this regard, the spruce bark beetle colonises only coniferous trees, essentially spruces, but not broad-leaf trees.</p>

As is clear from the remediation programme, that controversy related, in particular, to the very desirability of combating its spread, which, according to certain views in the scientific community, formed part of a natural cycle corresponding to periodic trends specific to the characteristics of the site whose preservation was the objective justifying the site’s designation in the list of SCIs and as an SPA. Consequently, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph 117 above, the Polish authorities could not adopt the 2016 appendix, as there was no scientific certainty that the active forest management operations at issue would not have lasting adverse effects on the integrity of the site concerned.</p>

On the contrary, as the Commission rightly maintains, in the absence of any impact on the authorised maximum total volume of timber extraction, the establishment of those areas, which, it is common ground, relate to a surface area of 17000 hectares representing approximately half the surface area of the two forest districts at issue, is liable to aggravate those effects, as the outcome will necessarily be an intensification of felling in the parts of those forest districts that are not excluded.</p>

Furthermore, whilst those exclusions are referred to by the Regional Director for Environmental Protection, Białystok, in the opinion which he issued on 12 February 2016 concerning the 2016 appendix, they do not appear in that appendix or Decision No 51 or even in Decision No 52.</p>

          Finally, in the fifth place, in so far as the Republic of Poland, in justifying some of the active forest management operations at issue on grounds relating to public safety or to the need to exploit the forest’s resources for economic and/or social reasons, may seek to rely on Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, it should be borne in mind that, whilst the main aim of that directive is admittedly to promote the maintenance of biodiversity, taking account of economic, social, cultural and regional requirements, the maintenance of such biodiversity may in certain cases require, in compliance with that provision, the maintenance, or indeed the encouragement, of human activities (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 September 2012, Nomarchiaki Aftodioikisi Aitoloakarnanias and Others,

          However, as a provision derogating from the criterion for authorisation laid down in the second sentence of Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, Article 6(4) thereof must be interpreted strictly and can be applied only after the implications of a plan or project have been analysed in accordance with Article 6(3) (see, inter alia, judgment of 21 July 2016, Orleans and Others,

          Indeed, under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if, in spite of a negative assessment carried out in accordance with the first sentence of Article 6(3) of that directive, a plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature, and there are no alternative solutions, the Member State is to take all compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected (see, inter alia, judgment of 21 July 2016, Orleans and Others,

          Accordingly, knowledge of the implications of a plan or project, in the light of the conservation objectives relating to the site in question, is a necessary prerequisite for the application of Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, since, in the absence thereof, no condition for the application of that derogating provision can be assessed.

          All species of saproxylic beetles covered by that strict protection need, during their life cycle, dead or dying trees, whether standing or on the ground. Various scientific studies confirm that dead spruces constitute an important habitat of the flat bark beetle and are of paramount importance in its life cycle. After two or three years of decay and in later stages of their decomposition, the spruces are invaded by other species of saproxylic beetle, such as the false darkling beetle and
          <span class="italic">Pytho kolwensis</span>
          . Accordingly, the intensification of felling of tree stands, essentially of spruce trees, and the removal of dry or dead wood and dying trees colonised by the spruce bark beetle inevitably lead to the death of specimens of those strictly protected species and to the destruction of their breeding sites and resting places.

          The prohibitions in Article 12 of the Habitats Directive are absolute, irrespective of the number and presence of specimens of the species covered by the strict conservation. The widespread presence of the flat bark beetle cannot therefore justify intensification of forest management operations liable to lead to an infringement of those prohibitions. Moreover, the false darkling beetle is a very rare species for which there are only four known habitats in Poland, so that the loss of a single habitat could have a considerable harmful impact on the maintenance of its conservation status in Europe. As for the goldstreifiger beetle, it is present in Poland only on the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site. Finally, that site is the most important habitat in Poland of

To ensure an appropriate state of protection, the Polish authorities have thus adopted a system of long-term conservation of habitat continuity for those species in the form of a network of forest plantation islets in reserves and of areas of protection around the protected species, on wet habitats, in the reference areas, and where dead trees are permanently and naturally present in all stands in Białowieża Forest. The effectiveness of that operation is demonstrated by the results of the survey carried out in 2016 by the Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa (Forest Research Institute, Poland).

          It is clear from those results that the flat bark beetle, for which the spruce is a second-choice habitat, is a species common throughout the Białowieża Forest site and for which dead and dying trees are not an essential habitat. As regards
          <span class="italic">Boros schneideri</span>
          , those results prove that it is a species which prefers pine, for which dead or dying spruce trees are not an essential habitat and which is also widespread in the whole of the Białowieża Forest. The key area for the false darkling beetle and
          <span class="italic">Rhysodes sulcatus</span>
          is the Białowieża National Park. The locations of the false darkling beetle in the district of Białowieża are to be found, moreover, in the reference areas. Furthermore, the essential cause of its disappearance is the absence of burned wood, Also, the presence of
          <span class="italic">Pytho kolwensis</span>
          is not reported outside that national park. The activity of the spruce bark beetle, on the other hand, could have a negative impact on the continuity of the environments occupied by that species, namely dead, old and felled spruce trees in wet habitats. Finally, as for the goldstreifiger beetle, the primary cause of its disappearance in Europe is the absence of old pine trees that have died following fires. Because of the lack of renewal of pine in the Białowieża National Park, the future of that species can be ensured only in harvested forests, in which pine has been artificially renewed.

In that regard, the Polish authorities have not adduced any evidence showing that the two species of woodpecker at issue benefit from intensification of tree felling where their habitats are located, whereas its intensification is, on the contrary, liable to accelerate the decline in numbers of those two species. Moreover, there is no data indicating whether, after the spread of the spruce bark beetle has ended, the population of those woodpecker species will recover to a greater or lesser degree.

Moreover, the Polish authorities have undertaken to maintain at least 60 pairs of each of those species. Furthermore, on all the Natura 2000 sites in Poland it is possible to find numbers of the two species of woodpecker at issue which are greater than those set out in the SDF. In particular, the value of the global abundance index of forest bird populations increased by 25% over the course of the 2000 to 2014 period.</p>

It is only the scale of the transformation that is impossible to foresee, that is to say, whether the decline in the stock numbers of species benefiting from the proliferation of a specific insect species will be limited to a return to the population level before the spread or whether, in view of the disappearance of food and the impossibility for the spruce bark beetle to colonise other trees, the stock of woodpeckers following that decline will be lower than that indicated, in particular, in the SDF in force and described in the conservation objectives of the site at issue.</p>

A permanent limitation of the spread of the spruce bark beetle, that is to say, a limitation of its territorial coverage and the maintenance of a high proportion of spruce trees in the stands, may be an active protection operation which maintains a relatively stable situation in relation to woodpecker populations, from a long-term perspective. Despite potential negative effects on those populations caused by the active forest management operations at issue, the size of those populations remains at a relatively high level, in accordance with the 2015 PZO, and any changes in the bird species’ ranges arising from predictive models of climate change are spread over a period of time. Consequently, the final effect of the temporary operations implemented using forest management methods may make it possible to remedy the subsequent significant decline in woodpecker numbers.</p>

That species, which nests in cavities hollowed out by woodpeckers, generally the great spotted woodpecker, a species with large stock numbers, does not show any preference as to the species of tree in which it reproduces. Furthermore, the pygmy owl is often present in degraded environments. Thus, it is more frequent in the developed part of the Białowieża Forest. Similarly, the boreal owl often occupies cavities hollowed out by the black woodpecker. The removal of spruce trees on 5% of the site at issue may therefore be regarded as having no impact from the point of view of the numbers of the pygmy owl and the boreal owl inhabiting the Białowieża Forest.</p>

In addition, the populations of those species increase in size and spread to new areas. ‘Biocenotic’ trees, including hollow trees, are left to their biological death. As a result, the potential nesting sites of the pygmy owl and boreal owl remain accessible, especially since the 2015 PZO provides for operations consisting in ‘the conservation, during management interventions, of all pines and firs with apparent cavities, except where there is a danger to the public’.</p>
