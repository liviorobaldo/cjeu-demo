To deliver consistent protection for retail clients and ensure a level playing field between similar products, it is important that insurance-based investment products are subject to appropriate requirements. Whereas the investor protection requirements in this directive should therefore be applied equally to those investments packaged under insurance contracts, their different market structures and product characteristics make it more appropriate that detailed requirements are set out in the ongoing review of Directive 2002/92/EC rather than setting them in this directive. Future Union law regulating the activities of insurance intermediaries and insurance undertakings should thus appropriately ensure a consistent regulatory approach concerning the distribution of different financial products which satisfy similar investor needs and therefore raise comparable investor protection challenges. … Those new requirements for insurance-based investment products should be laid down in Directive 2002/92/EC.’</p>

Firstly, to make the inclusion of an activity within the scope of this directive subject to the subjective intention of the insurance intermediary who pursues it would run counter to the principle of legal certainty, to the detriment of that intermediary’s clients. Secondly, as the European Commission observes, such a legal position would mean that the insurance intermediary could invoke his own fraudulent behaviour to escape his liability with regard to his customers by virtue of Directive 2002/92.</p>

In the present case, it appears, subject to verification by the referring court, that the contract at issue in the main proceedings constitutes an insurance contract within the meaning of that provision, which is, moreover, not disputed by Länsförsäkringar.</p>

It follows therefrom that the advice in question is subject, in particular, to the requirements set out in Article 12(2) and (3) of that directive, under which, when the insurance intermediary informs the customer that he gives his advice on the basis of a fair analysis, he is obliged, on the one hand, to give that advice on the basis of an analysis of a sufficiently large number of insurance contracts available on the market, to enable him to make a recommendation regarding which insurance contract would be adequate to meet the customer’s needs and, on the other, he must at least specify, prior to the conclusion of any specific contract, the demands and the needs of that customer as well as the underlying reasons for any advice given to the customer on a given insurance product, and those details must be modulated according to the complexity of the contract being proposed</p>

Those products are now defined in Article 2 of Directive 2002/92, in a new point 13, as insurance products which offer a maturity or surrender value which is wholly or partially exposed, directly or indirectly, to market fluctuations.</p>

Moreover, the fact that Chapter IIIA contains ‘additional’ requirements in relation to insurance-based investment products indicates that the mediation of such products already fell within the scope of Directive 2002/92 prior to its amendment by Directive 2014/65.</p>
