          Regarding the wording of the first limb of Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004, it is clear from that wording that the entitlement to unemployment benefits is guaranteed for a period of three months for a wholly unemployed person who goes to another Member State in order to seek work there. In that regard, the Court has previously ruled, in relation to Article 69 of Regulation No 1408/71, the predecessor provision to Article 64 of Regulation No 883/2004, that the first of those provisions enabled an unemployed worker to be exempt for a specific period, for the purpose of seeking employment in another Member State, from the obligation imposed by the various national laws to make himself available to the employment services of the competent State, without thereby losing his entitlement to unemployment benefits as against that State (judgments of 19 June 1980, Testa and Others,

          ). Such a conclusion applies equally to Regulation No 883/2004 since, in addition to guaranteeing the export of unemployment benefits for a period of three months, it also allows that period to be extended up to a maximum of six months.

However, subsequently, after the Rechtbank Amsterdam (District Court of Amsterdam), by judgment of 2 October 2013 delivered in the main proceedings, considered that reasons had to be given for refusal of a request to extend the export of unemployment benefits beyond three months, the Uwv decided, albeit without departing from the principle that a request of that nature is not to be granted, that in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, in particular the existence of a concrete and demonstrable prospect of employment, the granting of such a request can be justified. In particular, as is clear from the information contained in the order for reference, the Uwv considers that such circumstances are established when the person concerned is involved in a process likely to lead to actual employment and that requires his stay in the host Member State to be extended, or when the person concerned has submitted a declaration of intent from an employer offering him a genuine prospect of employment in that Member State.</p>
