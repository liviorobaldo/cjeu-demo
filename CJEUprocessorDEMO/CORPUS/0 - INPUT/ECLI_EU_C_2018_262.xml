Secondly, it noted that Directive 86/653 does not refer to any trial period so that it seems possible for the parties to a commercial agency contract to provide for such a period without that constituting an infringement of EU law. Thirdly, it pointed out, with reference to the Court of Justice’s case-law, that Directive 86/653 seeks to protect the commercial agent in his relations with the principal and that Article 17(2) of that directive is to be interpreted in such a way as to contribute to that protection.</p>

Similarly, Article 17(3) of that directive provides that a commercial agent is entitled to compensation for the damage he suffers as a result of ‘the termination of his relations with the principal’. Thus, the commercial agent’s right to indemnity or compensation is conditional on the termination of his contractual relationship with the principal.</p>

It follows that the provisions of that directive are applicable as soon as such a contract is concluded between the principal and the commercial agent, even if that contract provides for a trial period.</p>

        <p class="normal">Secondly, it is apparent from Article 17(2)(a) of Directive 86/653 that the commercial agent is entitled to an indemnity, inter alia, if he has brought the principal new customers or has significantly increased the volume of business with existing customers and the principal continues to derive substantial benefits from the business with such customers. Furthermore, according to Article 17(2)(b) of that directive, the amount of the indemnity depends on the performance of the commercial agent during the term of the contract. Similarly, it is clear from the wording of Article 17(3) of that directive that the commercial agent is entitled to compensation for damage suffered, in particular where such damage is deemed to occur when the termination of the contractual relations takes place in circumstances depriving that agent of the commission which performance of the contract would have procured him whilst providing the principal with substantial benefits linked to the agent’s activities and/or in circumstances which have not enabled the commercial agent to amortise the costs and expenses that he incurred for the performance of the contract on the principal’s advice.</p>

Consequently, the agent cannot be denied the indemnity or compensation on the sole ground that the termination of the commercial agency contract occurred during the trial period, if the conditions set out in Article 17(2) and (3) are satisfied.</p>

          In the first place, as regards the context of Article 17 of that directive, it should be noted, first, that Article 18 of the directive provides an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which indemnity or compensation for damage is not payable. Termination of the trial period is not mentioned. In addition, since Article 18 represents an exception to the right to indemnity and compensation, it must be interpreted strictly. It follows that that article cannot be interpreted in a way which amounts to adding a ground for exclusion of the indemnity or compensation for which no express provision is made (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 October 2010, Volvo Car Germany,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A647&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑203/09</a>

          ). To consider that no indemnity or compensation is payable when the termination of the contractual relationship occurs during the trial period is in fact tantamount to allowing a ground for exclusion not provided for in Article 18 of that directive.

          In that regard, the Court has held that Articles 17 and 18 of that directive are of crucial importance, as they define the level of protection which the European Union legislature considered reasonable to grant commercial agents in the course of the creation of the single market (judgment of 17 October 2013, Unamar,

Such an interpretation, which effectively makes the award of redress conditional on whether or not a trial period is provided for in the commercial agency contract, without regard for the performance of the commercial agent or the costs and expenses that he has incurred, contrary to the requirements of that article, constitutes, for the same reasons as those set out in paragraph 32 above, an interpretation detrimental to the commercial agent, who is denied any redress on the sole ground that the contract he has with the principal includes a trial period.</p>
