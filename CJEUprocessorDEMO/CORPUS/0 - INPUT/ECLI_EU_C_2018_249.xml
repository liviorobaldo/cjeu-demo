Those courts took the view that, with regard to the debit notes received by Flexipiso more than four years after the initial invoices were issued, Biosafe could not pass on the VAT relating to those invoices to Flexipiso as the latter no longer had the right to deduct VAT and as it was clear that the error regarding the applicable tax rate was attributable to Biosafe.</p>

          In addition, under Article 273 of the VAT Directive, the Member States may impose other obligations which they deem necessary for the correct collection of VAT and for the prevention of evasion. The prevention of tax evasion, avoidance and abuse is a recognised objective and is encouraged by that directive. However, the measures that the Member States may adopt under Article 273 of that directive must not go further than is necessary to attain such objectives. Therefore, they may not be used in such a way that they would have the effect of systematically undermining the right to deduct VAT and, consequently, the neutrality of VAT (judgment of 21 March 2018, Volkswagen,

          Since the refusal of the right of deduction is an exception to the application of the fundamental principle constituted by that right, it is incumbent upon the competent tax authorities to establish, to the requisite legal standard, that the objective evidence establishing the existence of a fraud or abuse is present. It is for the national courts subsequently to determine whether the tax authorities concerned have established the existence of such objective evidence (judgment of 28 July 2016, Astone,

Biosafe therefore made a VAT adjustment by paying the additional VAT and by issuing debit notes, which constitute, according to the referring court, documents rectifying the initial invoices.</p>

          The Portuguese Government takes the view that Biosafe and Flexipiso have intentionally and consistently, over at least two and a half years, put into effect systematic practices of tax evasion and avoidance. Indeed, the existence of such practices cannot be excluded in such a situation. However, in proceedings under Article 267 TFEU, which are based on a clear separation of functions between the national courts and tribunals and the Court of Justice, any assessment of the facts falls with the jurisdiction of the national courts and tribunals. In particular, the Court of Justice is empowered to rule only on the interpretation or the validity of European Union acts on the basis of the facts placed before it by the national court or tribunal (judgment of 8 May 2008, Danske Svineproducenter,

          Indeed, it was only following that adjustment that the substantive and formal conditions giving rise to a right to deduct VAT were met and that Flexipiso could therefore request to be relieved of the VAT burden due or paid in accordance with the VAT Directive and the principle of fiscal neutrality. Accordingly, since Flexipiso did not show any lack of diligence before the receipt of the debit notes, and failing any abuse or fraudulent collusion with Biosafe, a period which started to run from the date of issue of the initial invoices and which, for certain transactions, expired before this adjustment, could not validly be used to deny Flexipiso the exercise of the right to deduct VAT (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 March 2018, Volkswagen,
