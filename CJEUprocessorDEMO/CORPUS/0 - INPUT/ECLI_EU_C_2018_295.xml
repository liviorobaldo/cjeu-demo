        <p class="normal">The Agenzia delle Entrate (tax authorities, Italy) conducted a tax inspection of Siderlaghi. That inspection revealed that that company had failed to pay, within the time limit prescribed by law, the VAT resulting from its annual return for the tax year 2012, amounting to a total of EUR 175272. The tax authorities notified Siderlaghi of that irregularity and asked it to regularise its situation by paying the tax due, default interest and, in accordance with Article 13(1) of Legislative Decree No 471/97, a fine in the amount of 30% of its tax debt. The company undertook to discharge the unpaid VAT in instalments within 30 days of the notification and therefore received a reduction of two-thirds of the fine.</p>

That application was based on the fact that the failure to pay the VAT in question constituted the offence provided for and punished by Articles 10 bis and 10 ter of Legislative Decree No 74/2000 since, inter alia, the amount of unpaid VAT exceeded the criminalisation threshold of EUR 50000 above which such failure was punishable by the penalty laid down by those provisions, and on the fact that the offence was attributable to Mr Scialdone in his capacity as sole director of Siderlaghi.</p>

Moreover, Mr Scialdone could benefit from the ground for exemption from penalties now contained in Article 13 of Legislative Decree No 74/2000, as amended by Legislative Decree No 158/2015, since Siderlaghi and the tax authorities agreed for the VAT debt, fine and default interest to be paid by instalments.</p>

That court harbours doubts as to whether such a difference is compatible with the requirements arising from Article 4(3) TEU, Article 325 TFEU and the VAT Directive, since, in its view, it entails better protection of national financial interests than of the European Union’s financial interests.</p>

As is apparent from paragraph 37 above, such failures to comply with declaration obligations are not at issue in the present case. Moreover, while that provision also refers to the ‘misapplication of a legally obtained benefit’, it should be pointed out, as the German Government observes, that failure to pay declared VAT within the time limit prescribed by law does not give the taxable person such a benefit since the tax is still payable and the taxable person is acting unlawfully by failing to pay it.</p>

As observed by the Advocate General in points 68 and 69 of his Opinion, the term ‘illegal activities’ usually denotes unlawful behaviour, and the use of the word ‘any’ indicates the intention to encompass all unlawful behaviour, without distinction.

        <p class="normal">In the present case, Italian legislation provides that both a failure to pay withholding income tax and a failure to pay declared VAT constitute a criminal offence punishable by a penalty of six months to two years of imprisonment where the unpaid amount exceeds a certain criminalisation threshold. However, since the entry into force of Article 10 ter of Legislative Decree No 74/2000 as amended by Legislative Decree No 158/2015, the criminalisation threshold is set at EUR 250000 for a failure to pay VAT whereas, in accordance with Article 10 bis of Legislative Decree No 74/2000 as amended by Legislative Decree No 158/2015, it is set at only EUR 150000 for a failure to pay withholding income tax.</p>

        <p class="normal">Whereas the second offence relates to the conduct of taxable persons subject to VAT, the first offence relates not to the actions of persons subject to income tax but to the actions of the withholding agents required to remit the tax withheld in that regard. Moreover, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that, under Italian tax law, when such a withholding agent withholds an amount from the income of a person subject to tax, he is required to provide that person with a document called ‘certification’, which will allow him to demonstrate to the tax authorities that the amount in question has been withheld and, thus, that he has paid the tax due, even if, subsequently, the withholding agent fails to remit the amount withheld to the Treasury. That being so, the failure of the withholding agent to remit the tax withheld to the tax authorities may, on account of the issuance of that certification, prove more difficult to detect than a failure to pay declared VAT.</p>

          In view of those factors, those two offences cannot be regarded as being of a similar nature and importance, within the meaning of the case-law referred to in paragraph 28 above. Where two categories of offences can be distinguished by various circumstances concerning both the constituent elements of the offence and the degree of ease with which it can be detected, those differences mean, in particular, that the Member State concerned is not required to have an identical system of rules for the two categories of offences (judgment of 25 February 1988, Drexl,
