As the Advocate General observed, in point 49 of his Opinion, the Kingdom of Denmark and, until recently, the Republic of Finland consider that one operation cannot not have several loading points and several unloading points. The Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Poland allow several loading points and several unloading points where there is one single freight contract or where the goods have the same consignor or the same consignee. The Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Sweden consider that a cabotage operation can always have several loading and several unloading points. Such a difference of interpretation shows the lack of clarity and precision of Regulation No 1072/2009 regarding the definition of cabotage operations.</p>

Furthermore, as the Advocate General observed, in points 82 to 84 of his Opinion, Article 2(2) of the Rules of Procedure for the Committee on Road Transport states that the agenda drawn up for each meeting is to make a distinction between, on the one hand, proposed measures about which that committee is asked to give an opinion, in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, and, on the other hand, other issues put to that committee for information or a simple exchange of views. It is clear from the file before the Court that the interpretation of the definition of ‘cabotage operations’, as set out in that document, does in fact appear on the agenda of the Committee on Road Transport of 25 October 2010, but that it was not put to the vote. Therefore, that interpretation cannot be regarded as resulting from an agreement between the representatives of the Member States.
