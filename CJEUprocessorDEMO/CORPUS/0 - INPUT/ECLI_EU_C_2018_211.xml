        <p class="normal">Until May 2011 the cash withdrawal service was operated in the following manner. The network operator, after the PIN code was entered, checked that the customer’s bank account had sufficient funds and, if it did, allowed the cash to be withdrawn. The network operator also ensured that on each occasion RE was reimbursed amounts corresponding to the sums withdrawn by customers. RE for its part did not receive any remuneration in return for making the multifunctional terminals available, and it paid the network operator EUR 0.13 per transaction and a fixed monthly remuneration of EUR 48. In short, the only activity of RE consisted in loading the multifunctional terminals with cash.</p>

        <p class="normal">From June 2011, following an amendment to national legislation, in order to be able to continue supplying the cash withdrawal service without holding an authorisation as a payment service provider, RE partly changed the method of functioning of the multifunctional terminals installed in the gaming arcades, so that they offered a ‘cash back’ option. With this method, customers could no longer withdraw money from the multifunctional terminals unless they ordered at the same time a voucher for EUR 20 allowing them to put coins in the slot machines. That amount was debited to the customers’ accounts by their banks, in addition to the amount of cash withdrawn.</p>

On the basis of Paragraph 73 of the Criminal Code, it applied for forfeiture of all the sums credited to RE by the various banks of the customers who had made withdrawals. Those sums amounted to EUR 1096290. By judgment of 11 March 2015, the referring court, the Amtsgericht Nürtingen (Local Court, Nürtingen, Germany) acquitted Mr Rasool, on the ground that he had not provided payment services within the meaning of the Law on the supervision of payment services.</p>

Thus its application should, as stated in that recital, be confined to payment service providers whose ‘main activity’ consists in the provision of payment services to payment service users.</p>
