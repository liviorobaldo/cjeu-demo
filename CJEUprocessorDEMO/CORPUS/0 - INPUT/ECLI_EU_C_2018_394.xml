Finally, it would be contrary to Article 23(1) of Regulation No 73/2009, which requires that every act and omission is to lead, in principle, to a reduction in the total amount of direct payments granted or to be granted, and Article 24(1) of that regulation, which requires national authorities to take into account, inter alia, the seriousness of non-compliance with cross-compliance rules.
