          In that regard, the Court has consistently held that national legislation that subjects goods from other Member States, where they are lawfully manufactured and marketed, to certain conditions in order to be able to use the generic designation commonly used for that product, and which thus in certain cases requires producers to use designations which are unknown to, or less highly regarded by, consumers, does not absolutely preclude the importation into the Member State concerned of products originating in other Member States.

According to recital 7 of that directive, those standards are intended to guarantee the protection of pigs kept for rearing and fattening in order to ensure rational development of production. To that end, as stated in recital 8, the directive provides for various rules intended, inter alia, to ensure that pigs have an environment corresponding to their needs for exercise and investigatory behaviour.</p>
