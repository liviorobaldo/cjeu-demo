Furthermore, it submits that, inasmuch as Directive 2004/38 does not regulate the effects arising from the annulment judgment of 29 September 2015, namely the period within which a new decision must be taken by the competent national authority following the judicial annulment of an initial decision, that question is a matter of national law. In any case, the Belgian State takes the view that it has not been demonstrated that opening a new six-month period in which to decide on an application for a residence card following a judicial annulment is unreasonable.</p>

That court considers that, in order to apply national law in accordance with the requirements of Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38, it must be determined whether that provision must be interpreted as meaning that the decision as to whether to recognise a right of residence must be taken and notified within the period of six months.</p>

More specifically, it entertains doubts as to the time period available to the competent national authority to decide on an application for a residence card following the judicial annulment of its initial decision refusing to grant the right at issue. In that regard, the court considers that, in order to determine that new time period, it must be ascertained whether the principle of effectiveness precludes the competent national authority being allowed the full six-month period provided for in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38, following the annulment of its decision.</p>

In that regard, the referring court explains that, if it were apparent that the time period referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38 had actually been exceeded in the case in the main proceedings, and that the directive did not preclude the residence card sought being issued as a consequence of exceeding that period, the decision of 9 November 2015, refusing to grant the residence card to Mr Diallo, should then be considered unlawful.</p>
