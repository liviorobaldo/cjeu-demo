The purpose of that contract was to replace Mr Moreira Gómez’s mother who had occupied that post and taken partial retirement, reducing her working hours and remuneration by 75%. The parties to the contract agreed that it would terminate on 18 September 2015, the date on which Mr Moreira Gómez’s mother was to take full retirement.

          It should be recalled in that regard that, according to Clause 1(a) of the Framework Agreement, one of its objectives is to improve the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring the application of the principle of non-discrimination. Similarly, the third paragraph in the preamble to the Framework Agreement states that it ‘illustrates the willingness of the Social Partners to establish a general framework for ensuring equal treatment for fixed-term workers by protecting them against discrimination’. Recital 14 of Directive 1999/70 states, to this end, that the aim of the Framework Agreement is, inter alia, to improve the quality of fixed-term work by setting out minimum requirements in order to ensure the application of the principle of non-discrimination (judgments of 22 December 2010, Gavieiro Gavieiro and Iglesias Torres,

          It is therefore necessary, second, to establish whether the payment of compensation by an employer on account of the termination of an employment contract falls within the concept of ‘employment conditions’ within the meaning of Clause 4(1) of the Framework Agreement. In that regard, the Court has held that the decisive criterion for determining whether a measure falls within the scope of that concept is the criterion of employment, that is to say the employment relationship between a worker and his employer (judgments of 12 December 2013, Carratù,

          The Court has thus held that, inter alia, rules for determining the notice period applicable in the event of termination of fixed-term employment contracts fall within that concept (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 March 2014 in Nierodzik,

        <p class="normal">In the present case, the Spanish Government relies on the difference between the context in which compensation, such as that provided for in Article 49(1)(c) of the Workers’ Statute, is paid, when a fixed-term employment contract, such as the fixed-term relief contract, expires, and the context which calls for payment of the higher amount of compensation provided for in the event of dismissal on one of the grounds set out in Article 52 of that statute, such as economic or technical grounds or grounds relating to the employer’s organisation or production when the number of posts lost is lower than that required in order to classify the termination of employment contracts as a ‘collective dismissal’. That government states, in essence, that while the Spanish legislator introduced the first form of compensation in order to prevent excessive recourse to temporary employment and to enhance employment stability, such compensation is paid when an event that could have been foreseen by the worker when he entered into the fixed-term employment contract occurs. Therefore, the purpose of that compensation is not, unlike the second form of compensation, to compensate for the frustration of a worker’s legitimate expectation that his employment relationship would continue, as a result of his dismissal on one of the grounds set out in Article 52 of the statute. Such a difference explains why the level of compensation awarded to the worker on termination of his employment contract is not the same in both cases.</p>

Thus, the parties to a fixed-term employment contract are aware, from the moment of its conclusion, of the date or event which determines its end.

As is clear from the Spanish Government’s explanations set out in paragraph 55 above and as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in point 60 of her Opinion, it is precisely in order to compensate for the unforeseen nature of the termination of the employment relationship for such a reason and, accordingly, the frustration of any legitimate expectations the worker may have had at that date as regards the stability of that relationship, that Article 53(1)(b) of the Workers’ Statute requires compensation equivalent to twenty days’ remuneration per year of service to be paid to the dismissed worker.</p>
