In that regard, it submits that that protection requires landfilled waste not to present a risk to human health and the environment. Therefore, bearing that aim in mind, in accordance with Article 14 of that directive, a definite decision of the competent authorities is essential for the continued operation or closure of existing landfill sites. Similarly, Article 13 of the directive lays down requirements for landfill site closure and after-care procedures. In the third place, the Commission proposes, however, that it be taken into account that only one landfill site is in question and the relevant geographical area is limited to the vicinity of the site in question and that landfill waste at that site has been suspended since 30 December 2013. As a mitigating factor, regard should also be had to the measures which the Slovak Republic has taken to comply with the judgment in Case C‑331/11, even if those measures have been insufficient.</p>

          For the purposes of determining the amount of a penalty payment, the basic criteria which must be taken into consideration in order to ensure that that payment has coercive effect and that EU law is applied uniformly and effectively are, in principle, the seriousness of the infringement, its duration and the ability to pay of the Member State in question. In applying those criteria, regard must be had, in particular, to the effects on public and private interests of the failure to comply and to how urgent it is for the Member State concerned to be induced to fulfil its obligations (judgment of 22 June 2016, Commission v Portugal,
