          On the one hand, that obligation is, in fact, inextricably linked to that, incumbent on each Member State, to take all legislative and administrative measures appropriate for ensuring collection of all the VAT due on its territory.

The deduction of input taxes is linked to the collection of output taxes.

        <p class="normal">It is apparent from the second subparagraph of Article 187(2) of the VAT Directive that the adjustment provided for by that provision, so far as concerns capital goods, is made on the basis of the variations in the deduction entitlement which arise subsequent to the acquisition of those goods, their manufacture or their first use. Thus the detailed rules for the adjustment of VAT described in Article 187 of the VAT Directive relate to the particular situation, referred to in Article 185(1) of the VAT Directive, of a change, subsequent to the VAT return, in the factors used to determine the amount to be deducted. They therefore cannot be used to adjust a deduction made in the absence of any initial right of deduction. Some of those rules, such as those on adjustment spread over five years, for which the first subparagraph of Article 187(2) of the VAT Directive provides, are, moreover, manifestly unsuited to such a situation. As regards Article 188 of the VAT Directive, this covers the even more special and equally different situation of the supply of capital goods during the adjustment period.</p>

          Secondly, it should be stated that the principle of legal certainty does not preclude an administrative practice on the part of national tax authorities consisting in revoking, within a mandatory time limit, a decision in which they acknowledged that the taxable person had a right to a VAT deduction, by demanding that he pay that tax (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Nigl and Others,

          and the case-law cited). For that reason, the fact that the starting point of the mandatory time limit depends on the fortuitous circumstances in which the unlawfulness of the deduction came to light, and, in particular, that it should be set, as the Lithuanian Government claims, at the date of receipt by the purchaser of the credit note whereby the vendor unilaterally adjusted the price, net of VAT, of the land by including the VAT several years after the sale, is likely to breach the principle of legal certainty, a matter which it is for the national court to assess.
