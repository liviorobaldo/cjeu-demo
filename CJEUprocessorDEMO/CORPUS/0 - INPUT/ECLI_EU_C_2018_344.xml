As is clear from Article 32(1) of Regulation No 1083/2006, that regulation covers operational programmes in the period from 2007 to 2013, whereas Regulation No 1303/2013 covers the period from 2014 to 2020, in accordance with Article 26(1) of that regulation.</p>

          According to settled case-law of the Court, Article 267 TFEU establishes a procedure for direct cooperation between the Court and the courts of the Member States. In that procedure, which is based on a clear separation of functions between the national courts and the Court, any assessment of the facts of the case is a matter for the national court, which must determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court, whilst the Court is empowered to give rulings on the interpretation or the validity of an EU provision only on the basis of the facts which the national court puts before it (see, inter alia, judgment of 25 October 2017, Polbud — Wykonawstwo,

          In that regard, it is settled case-law that, by providing that the property and assets of the European Union may not be the subject of any administrative or legal measure of constraint without the authorisation of the Court, Article 1 of the Protocol is intended to prevent any interference with the functioning and independence of the European Union. It is clear from the wording of that provision that such immunity is automatic and, in the absence of the authorisation of the Court, prevents the execution of any measure of constraint against the European Union without there being any need for the institution concerned to expressly rely on Article 1 of the Protocol (order of 29 September 2015, ANKO v Commission,

        <p class="normal">In the present case, the Italian Republic submits that prior authorisation from the Court is required in view of, first, the fact that sums deriving from the ESF must be allocated to particular expenditure and, secondly, the nature of the tasks devolved in that regard to the Region of Lombardy under EU law. Thus it argues that resources deriving from the Funds must be hypothecated to particular expenditure, meaning that those resources must be designated for the implementation of EU policies and cannot be diverted from that purpose. That hypothecation remains intact when those resources are transferred to the national entities that are then regarded as mere managing authorities. It takes the view that the hypothecation of the resources to particular expenditure ends only once the objective pursued by the European Union has been fully realised and, therefore, only once the sums have passed into the ownership of the beneficiary. Furthermore, the Italian Republic claims that, in accordance with the organisational model of indirect implementation, national authorities are thus contributing to the implementation of a task falling within the competence of EU bodies. It follows that, in carrying out that activity, the national authorities are not performing their own tasks, but are rather performing European tasks, on the basis of their own legislative and administrative powers.</p>
