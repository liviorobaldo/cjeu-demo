          As the referring court is also uncertain as to whether the Specific Mechanisms cover the SPC extension — if the question is answered in the affirmative, the defendant in the main proceedings would not be able to rely on the exhaustion of rights for the period from 1 February to 1 August 2015 — that court observes that the wording of the Acts of Accession merely distinguishes the basic patent from the SPC and does not refer to Regulation No 1901/2006. According to the referring court, the fact that the purpose of the SPC and that of its extension are identical nonetheless supports that affirmative answer. It notes, however, that that reasoning is opposed by the need to interpret the Specific Mechanisms narrowly, as well as the regard to be had to the hierarchy of norms, inasmuch as a secondary legislative act, in the present case Regulation No 1901/2006, would broaden — in some cases

          However, as is the case in the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties (

          ), the Acts of Accession of 2003, 2005 and 2012 lay down, as observed by the Advocate General in point 47 of his Opinion, specific mechanisms that seek to achieve a balance between the free movement of goods and the effective protection of intellectual and industrial property rights granted under a basic patent. For that purpose, those mechanisms enable the holder of the basic patent to rely on his exclusive rights against importers in situations in which those rights would otherwise be exhausted under the Court’s case-law. Those mechanisms therefore seek to prevent a situation in which full application of internal market principles after the accession of the new Member States would expose the holder of the basic patent to parallel imports from those States without having been able to protect his invention in those States and, as a result, without having received adequate compensation.

          In order for an SPC to be granted, however, the cumulative conditions set out in Article 3 of the SPC Regulation must be fulfilled. That provision provides, in essence, that an SPC can be granted only if, at the date of the application, the product is protected by a basic patent in force and has not already been the subject of an SPC. In addition, that product must have been granted a marketing authorisation as a medicinal product which is still valid, in accordance with Directive 2001/83 or Directive 2001/82, as appropriate; and, lastly, that marketing authorisation must be the first in relation to that product as a medicinal product (judgment of 15 January 2015, Forsgren,
