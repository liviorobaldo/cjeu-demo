          Next, with regard to whether, failing any express legislative provision or specific condition in the call for tenders or the tender specifications governing the conditions for the award of a public contract, tenderers are nonetheless obliged to disclose the links between them to the contracting authority, it must be noted that the Court has stated that the principles of transparency and equal treatment which govern all public procurement procedures require the substantive and procedural conditions concerning participation in a contract to be clearly defined in advance and made public, in particular the obligations of tenderers, in order that those tenderers may know exactly the procedural requirements and be sure that the same requirements apply to all candidates (judgment of 2 June 2016, Pizzo,

          That case-law is, in the light of the findings in paragraph 29 of the present judgment, applicable to situations such as that at issue in the main proceedings where related tenderers are participants in a public procurement procedure.

          As regards a case such as that in the main proceedings, the finding that the links between tenderers had a bearing on the content of the tenders they submitted during the same procedure suffices, in principle, for those tenders not to be taken into consideration by the contracting authority, as tenders by related undertakings must be submitted completely autonomously and independently. However, a mere finding of a relationship of control between the undertakings concerned, by reason of ownership or the number of voting rights exercisable at ordinary shareholders’ meetings, is not sufficient for the contracting authority to exclude automatically those tenders from the procedure for the award of the contract, without ascertaining whether such a relationship had a specific effect on the independence of those tenders (see, by analogy, judgment of 19 May 2009, Assitur,

        <p class="normal">It is for the referring court, in the light of the circumstances of the dispute in the main proceedings, to carry out the necessary verifications and assessments in that regard, as well as with regard to the circumstances in paragraph (a) of the fourth question and to the probative value of the spontaneous declaration made by a tenderer, mentioned in paragraph (b) of that question. In the event that that court should come to the conclusion, following those verifications and assessments, that the tenders at issue in the main proceedings were not submitted autonomously and independently, it is to be recalled that Article 2 of Directive 2004/18 must be interpreted as precluding the award of the contract to the tenderers having submitted those tenders.</p>

If the offers prove not to be autonomous and independent, Article 2 of Directive 2004/18 precludes the award of the contract to the tenderers having submitted those tenders.</p>
