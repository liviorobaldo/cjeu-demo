The referring court therefore considers that a taxable person who has made a payment on account should not adjust the deduction unless that payment has been refunded.</p>

          However, Article 65 of Directive 2006/112 provides, by way of derogation, that, where a payment is to be made on account before the goods or services are supplied, VAT is to become chargeable on receipt of the payment and on the amount received. As an exception to the rule recalled in the preceding paragraph, that provision must be interpreted strictly (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 February 2006, BUPA Hospitals and Goldsborough Developments,

          Thus, in order for the VAT to become chargeable in such circumstances, all the relevant information concerning the chargeable event, namely the future supply of goods or services, must already be known and therefore, in particular, when the payment on account is made, the goods or services must be precisely identified (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 February 2006, BUPA Hospitals and Goldsborough Developments,

          The adjustment mechanism provided for in Articles 184 to 186 of Directive 2006/112 is an integral part of the VAT deduction scheme established by that directive. It is intended to enhance the precision of deductions so as to ensure the neutrality of VAT, so that transactions effected at an earlier stage continue to give rise to the right to deduct only to the extent that they are used to make supplies subject to VAT. That mechanism thus aims to establish a close and direct relationship between the right to deduct input VAT and the use of the goods or services concerned for taxable output transactions (judgments of 18 October 2012, TETS Haskovo,

          As regards the coming into existence of an obligation to make an adjustment of an input VAT deduction, Article 185(1) of Directive 2006/112 establishes the principle that such an adjustment is to be made, in particular, where, after the VAT return is made, some change occurs in the factors used to determine the amount to be deducted (judgments of 4 October 2012, PIGI,

          ), the Court held that, in a situation such as that at issue in the case which gave rise to that judgment, in which it was established that the supply of goods in respect of which the buyer had made a payment on account would not take place, it must be considered that, after the VAT return was made, a change has occurred in the factors used to determine the amount of input VAT to be deducted, within the meaning of Article 185(1) of Directive 2006/112. In such a situation, the tax authorities may therefore require adjustment to be made to the VAT deducted by the taxable person.

          ), cases of VAT fraud. In this respect, it is considered as established by the referring court that the VAT relating to the payments on account at issue in the main proceedings was paid to the State Treasury by the suppliers. In addition, in so far as those suppliers, in view of their insolvency, will not repay those payments on account, the VAT payable by those suppliers to the Treasury in respect of the receipt of those payments on account will not have to be adjusted pursuant to the combined provisions of Articles 65, 90 and 123 of Directive 2006/112. Accordingly, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, the exercise by the buyers of the right to deduct VAT in respect of those same payments on account does not entail any risk of a loss of tax revenue for the State Treasury.

          Concerning cases where VAT has been unduly invoiced because of the lack of a taxable transaction, the Court has held that it is true that the principles of neutrality and effectiveness do not, as a rule, preclude national legislation according to which only the supplier may seek a refund from the competent tax authorities of the sums he has paid them in error by way of VAT, it being the responsibility of the buyer of the goods to bring an action against that supplier in order that he may, in turn, obtain a refund of those sums from that supplier. However, the Court has also held that, if such an action becomes impossible or excessively difficult, in particular in the case of the insolvency of the supplier, those principles may require that the buyer be able to address his request for a refund to the tax authorities directly (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 March 2007, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken,
