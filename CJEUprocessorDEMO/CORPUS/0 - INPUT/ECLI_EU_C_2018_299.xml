        <p class="normal">In the first place, the General Court examined the third plea in law. First of all, it rejected the assertion that the third successful tenderer in the cascade procedure, namely the Drasis consortium, was subject to a conflict of interests within the meaning of Article 94(a) of the Financial Regulation because it included the company that had drafted the tender specifications. Next, the General Court also rejected the argument that there was a conflict of interests in relation to the Unisys consortium. By contrast, the General Court upheld the third part of the third plea in law, considering that EUIPO had clearly breached its duty of diligence when investigating the existence of the ground for exclusion provided for in point 13.1, first paragraph, subparagraph (e) of the tender specifications and in Article 93(1)(e) of the Financial Regulation. In particular, the General Court considered that EUIPO was not entitled simply to rely on Siemens SA’s solemn declaration as evidence that there was no ground for exclusion concerning the Drasis consortium’s situation within the meaning of point 13.1, first paragraph, subparagraph (e), of the tender specifications and Article 93(1)(e) of the Financial Regulation. It found that that evidence was even less appropriate for the purposes of demonstrating the absence of that ground for exclusion with respect to Siemens SL, in respect of which EUIPO had neither sought nor produced relevant evidence.</p>

        <p class="normal">In addition, relying on the comparative table of technical tenders set out in paragraph 14 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court considered that European Dynamics Luxembourg’s technical tender had obtained, on the basis of qualitative criteria 1 to 3, after weighting of the net points awarded, the maximum score of 100 gross points, whereas the tenders of the three successful tenderers had obtained only a significantly lower number of gross and net points, some just above the exclusion threshold of 45, 15 and 10 points respectively, for qualitative criteria 1 to 3. Thus, the 87.90 net points awarded to European Dynamics Luxembourg’s tender were increased to 100 gross points, whereas the 71.96 net points awarded to the IECI tender were increased to 81.86 gross points, the 70.66 net points awarded to the Unisys tender were increased to 80.38 gross points and the 78.05 net points awarded to the Drasis tender were increased to 88.78 gross points.</p>

          , in breach of Article 21 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of Article 76 and Article 84(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court. It argues that it is clear from paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal and from the minutes of the hearing before the General Court that European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others had withdrawn the third part of their third plea in law. As that part was, consequently, no longer disputed by the parties, the General Court should have refrained from examining it. By ruling on that part regardless in paragraphs 64 to 78 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court exceeded its jurisdiction. In the alternative, EUIPO argues that the General Court erred in law in finding that infringing the principles of equal opportunities and diligence could entail annulment of the decisions at issue.

The only argument withdrawn by European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others was that relating to the structural links between the companies participating in the Drasis consortium and their parent company, namely Siemens AG. Accordingly, the other arguments invoked in support of that plea in law were maintained, including those relating to EUIPO’s obligation to comply with the rules set out in the Financial Regulation and the tender specifications and to the infringement of the principle of equal treatment.</p>

Accordingly, the General Court should have examined whether those other comments were still sufficient to justify the score given by the contracting authority for the award criterion concerned, and the fact that the General Court did not do so is in itself sufficient reason to set aside the judgment under appeal.</p>

In that regard, EUIPO notes that several Member States do not provide for the possibility of awarding damages solely on the basis of the loss of an opportunity to obtain a contract, including the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Romania, where damages for loss of opportunity are limited to the costs incurred in preparing the tender.</p>

          ), the award of damages is an appropriate means of providing compensation for damage suffered by an unsuccessful tenderer due to loss of opportunity. Therefore, the General Court was not required to demonstrate the existence of a protection mechanism common to the Member States, especially as it had already acknowledged that the loss of opportunity suffered by an unsuccessful tenderer constitutes actual and certain damage. Nor, in those circumstances, can the causal link between the unlawful conduct complained of and the damage suffered by European Dynamics Luxembourg be denied on the grounds that the contracting authority had broad discretion.

          It should be borne in mind from the outset that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, for EUIPO to be non-contractually liable, a set of cumulative conditions must be satisfied, namely, the unlawfulness of its conduct, the fact of damage and the existence of a causal link between the alleged conduct and the damage complained of (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, Nikolaou v Court of Auditors,
