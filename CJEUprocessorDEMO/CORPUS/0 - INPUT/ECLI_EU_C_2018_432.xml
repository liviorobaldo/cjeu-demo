What is at issue in the present case is a single, complex transaction, consisting of the redemption of shares combined with the transfer to a shareholder of consideration in kind in exchange for the shares redeemed. Redemption of the shares is thus closely linked to the transfer of ownership of the assets as payment, those two aspects of the transaction being interdependent. It follows that the transfer of the immovable property to the shareholder cannot be analysed as an autonomous and separate transaction subject to VAT, since, in accordance with the Law on VAT, the redemption of shares is not such a transaction.</p>

Thus, it must be recalled, in particular, that those provisions, read together, have led the Court to make a distinction between old and new buildings, the sale of an old building not being, as a rule, subject to VAT (see, inter alia, judgments of 12 July 2012, J.J. Komen en Zonen Beheer Heerhugowaard,

          With regard to the ‘redemption’ of the shares, it is the settled case-law of the Court that the mere acquisition and holding of shares are not to be regarded as an ‘economic activity’ within the meaning of the VAT Directive. Indeed, the mere acquisition of financial holdings in other undertakings does not amount to the exploitation of property for the purpose of obtaining income therefrom on a continuing basis because any dividend yielded by those holdings is merely the result of ownership of the property and is not the consideration for any economic activity within the meaning of that directive (judgment of 26 May 2005, Kretztechnik,
