          ), which concerns a provision of Belgian tax law which is analogous to Paragraph 1 of the AStG, that the latter provision must be regarded as a restriction on freedom of establishment which is not justified due to the fact that it is disproportionate. Contrary to the requirements stemming from that judgment, Paragraph 1 of the AStG does not contain any provision concerning the opportunity to present commercial justification in order to explain a non-arm’s-length transaction. In the present case, according to Hornbach-Baumarkt AG, commercial reasons explain why no remuneration was given for the comfort letters at issue in the main proceedings. Those commercial reasons relate to supportive actions to replace the equity capital of the foreign group companies.

          According to the case-law of the Court, such a difference in the tax treatment of taxpayers based on the place where the companies with which an agreement on non-arm’s-length terms have been made have their registered office is liable to constitute a restriction of freedom of establishment, within the meaning of Article 43 EC. The taxpayer might thereby be deterred from acquiring, creating or maintaining a subsidiary in a Member State other than its Member State of residence or from acquiring or maintaining a substantial holding in a company established in that other Member State because of the tax burden imposed, in a cross-border situation, on the agreement entered into on non-arm’s-length terms (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 January 2010, SGI,

          The Court has held that allowing companies resident in a Member State to transfer their profits, in the form of unusual or gratuitous advantages, to companies with which they have a relationship of interdependence and which are established in other Member States may well undermine the balanced allocation of the power to tax between the Member States and that legislation of a Member State providing that the resident company is to be taxed in respect of such advantages which it has granted to a company established in another Member State allows the former Member State to exercise its tax jurisdiction in relation to activities carried out in its territory.

For the purposes of assessing the proportionality of legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, it is necessary, moreover, to distinguish between, on the one hand, the possibility of relying on the reasons why advantages were granted gratuitously between companies in the same group, and, on the other hand, the assessment of the substance of those advantages. Hornbach-Baumarkt AG had the opportunity to present the reasons for its decision but could not show that those reasons corresponded to economic reasons.

Since the continuation and expansion of the business operations of those foreign companies was contingent, due to a lack of sufficient equity capital, upon a provision of capital, the gratuitous granting of comfort letters containing a guarantee statement, even though companies independent from one another would have agreed on remuneration for such guarantees, could be explained by the economic interest of Hornbach-Baumarkt AG itself in the financial success of the foreign group companies, in which it participates through the distribution of profits, as well as by a certain responsibility of the applicant in the main proceedings, as a shareholder, in the financing of those companies.</p>
