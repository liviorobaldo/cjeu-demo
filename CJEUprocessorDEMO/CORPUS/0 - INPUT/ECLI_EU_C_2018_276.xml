In those circumstances, the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) considered that, even though MP could, in principle, be returned to Sri Lanka without suffering harm, once there he would be in the hands of the Sri Lankan mental health services, with the result that, in view of the severity of his mental illness and the fact that he would be unable to access appropriate care, returning him to Sri Lanka would be in breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.</p>

          Pursuant to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the same threshold of severity must be met in order for Article 3 of the ECHR to preclude the deportation of a person whose illness is not naturally occurring where the lack of care that would be available to that person, once expelled, is not attributable to intentional acts or omissions of the receiving State (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 29 January 2013,

          As regards, specifically, the threshold of severity for finding a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR, it follows from the most recent case-law of the European Court of Human Rights that that provision precludes the removal of a seriously ill person where he is at risk of imminent death or where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that, although not at imminent risk of dying, he would face a real risk, on account of the absence of appropriate treatment in the receiving country or the lack of access to such treatment, of suffering a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his state of health resulting in intense suffering or to a significant reduction in life expectancy (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 13 December 2016,

          Similarly, Article 4 of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that the removal of a third country national with a particularly serious mental or physical illness constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment, within the meaning of that article, where such removal would result in a real and demonstrable risk of significant and permanent deterioration in the state of health of the person concerned (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 February 2017, C.K. and Others,

          In that regard, the Court has held that, particularly in the case of a serious psychiatric illness, it is not sufficient to consider only the consequences of physically transporting the person concerned from a Member State to a third country; rather, it is necessary to consider all the significant and permanent consequences that might arise from the removal (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 February 2017, C.K. and Others,

          ). Moreover, given the fundamental importance of the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment laid down in Article 4 of the Charter, particular attention must be paid to the specific vulnerabilities of persons whose psychological suffering, which is likely to be exacerbated in the event of their removal, is a consequence of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment in their country of origin.

          As is apparent from its sixth recital and Article 2, the main objective of the Convention against Torture is to make more effective the struggle against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world, by means of prevention. However, the main objective of Directive 2004/83, as set out in its sixth recital, is, on the one hand, to ensure that Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection, and, on the other hand, to ensure that a minimum level of benefits is available for those persons in all Member States. As regards, more specifically, the beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status, that directive aims to offer, within the territory of the Member States, protection similar to that afforded to refugees by the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, signed in Geneva on 28 July 1951 (
