          ). However, in the context of the present request for a preliminary ruling, the referring court has raised the question of whether there can be a ‘supply of goods’ within the meaning of Article 14(2)(a) of the VAT Directive in circumstances where only a legal transfer of ownership of the goods has occurred, in return for the payment of compensation, while the party having economic control over the relevant goods remained the same. That particularity of Polish administrative law, according to which, in the event of expropriation by the Public Treasury of immovable property belonging to a county city, those goods are to continue to be administered by that same entity, represented by the mayor, may be sufficient to deprive the transfer of ownership at issue, at least partially, of its economic nature, on the ground that the expropriating authority does not have the power to dispose of the goods at issue as an owner.

          With regard to the consideration for the relevant transaction, it follows from the settled case-law of the Court that the fact that a supply of goods is made ‘for consideration’, within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a) of the VAT Directive, presupposes the existence of a direct link between the goods supplied and the consideration received (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 October 2010, Loyalty Management UKand Baxi Group,

          and the case-law cited). Such a direct link exists only if there is a legal relationship between the supplier and the purchaser entailing reciprocal performance, the price received by the supplier constituting the value actually given in return for the goods supplied (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 May 2017, Posnania Investment,

          However, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in point 61 of his Opinion, it is irrelevant whether, in order for there to be a ‘payment of compensation’ within the meaning of Article 14(2)(a) of the VAT Directive, it is necessary that such a payment have all the constitutive elements of the concept of ‘consideration’ referred to in Article 2(1)(a) of that directive, due to the first of those provisions being a
