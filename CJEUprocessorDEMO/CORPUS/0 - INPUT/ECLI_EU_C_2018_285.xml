However, the reasoned opinion concerned only IBA Rila, since, in the meantime, the Kaliakra IBA had been the subject of a specific infringement procedure, on which the Court ruled in its judgment of 14 January 2016, Commission v Bulgaria (

          Nonetheless, although the reasoned opinion must contain a coherent and detailed statement of the reasons which led the Commission to conclude that the Member State in question has failed to fulfil one of its obligations under the Treaty, the letter of formal notice cannot be subject to such strict requirements of precision, since it cannot, of necessity, contain anything more than an initial brief summary of the complaints.

          With regard to the complaint alleging an insufficient statement of the subject-matter of the proceedings in the application, it must be noted that, by virtue of Article 120(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice and the case-law relating thereto, an application initiating proceedings must state the subject matter of the dispute and include a brief statement of the pleas in law. That statement must be sufficiently clear and precise to enable the defendant to prepare his defence and the Court to rule on the application.

According to that Member State, although the IBA inventory constitutes, in the absence of scientific proof to the contrary, a basis of reference for assessing whether that Member State has classified as SPAs sufficient territories in number and size to provide protection for all the bird species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive, such an inventory is not legally binding (judgment of 7 December 2000, Commission v France,

In so doing, the Commission distorts the arguments presented by the Republic of Bulgaria during the pre-litigation period. In fact, the present action does not concern the importance of IBA Rila for the conservation of birds. The Republic of Bulgaria maintains in that regard that the classification of 72% of IBA Rila is such as to ensure a maximum level of protection of species and their habitats. Next, the Commission refers, in its application, to data contained in a table provided by the Republic of Bulgaria in the additional information of July 2009 and draws certain conclusions from those data. However, it is not possible to determine on what precise data the Commission relies in that regard. Finally, according to the Commission, it is clear from the available data and analyses that there is restricted coverage for 17 bird species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive. However, it would appear that the Commission’s findings are based mainly on information, the relevance and reliability of which are doubtful, from non-governmental bodies.</p>

In that regard, that Member State sends a series of data which, it alleges, cast doubt on the accuracy of the BDZP data used by the Commission, such that it is necessary to collect additional scientific data. The data from the BDZP themselves give rise to doubts as to the need to classify the entirety of IBA Rila as an SPA. In that context, even though it is for the BDZP to make the selection and the initial assessment of regions which are IBAs in Bulgaria, it has not submitted either to the competent Bulgarian authorities or to scientific experts the information which it holds concerning the ornithological data for the areas outside the designated SPAs.</p>

Consequently, by having drawn a distinction, in order to identify the most suitable territories for classification as SPAs, between the most important territories for the conservation of the species referred to in Article 4(1) of that directive, and the less significant territories subject to severe anthropogenic pressure, the Republic of Bulgaria did not stay within the limits of the discretion enjoyed by the Member States.</p>
