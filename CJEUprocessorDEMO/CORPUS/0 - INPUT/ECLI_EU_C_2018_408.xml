In addition, that provision could apply only if the proceedings had been initiated by the maintenance debtor or if the court seised was that of a State in which none of the parties concerned has his residence. In the present case, KP has seized a court in the State of his current habitual residence.

However, the application of that provision in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings is uncertain. That court refers, in this connection, to paragraph 63 of the Explanatory Report of Mr Bonomi on the Hague Protocol (text adopted by the Twenty-First Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law) (‘the Bonomi Report’), according to which the subsidiary connection to the law of the forum is only of use if the maintenance proceedings are instituted in a State other than that of the creditor’s habitual residence, since otherwise the law of the creditor’s habitual residence and the law of the forum coincide. The referring court adds that, according to that report, the subsidiary application of the law of the forum under Article 4(2) can be envisaged only if the proceedings are initiated by the debtor, for instance before the competent authority of the State of his own habitual residence or if the authority seised is that of a State in which none of the parties concerned is resident.</p>

          That first finding is such as to raise doubts as to the pertinence of the Commission’s arguments. The applicability in principle of the law of the State of the creditor’s habitual residence laid down in Article 3(1) of the Hague Protocol is limited by the second paragraph of that Article to the period covered by that residence. If Article 4(2) of the Protocol were to be interpreted to the effect that it allows the law of the forum, that is to say, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, the law of the State of the creditor’s new habitual residence, always to be applicable to the period prior to the fixing of residence in that State, providing the condition laid down in that provision is met, that interpretation would be tantamount to rendering redundant the general rule set out in Article 3(2) regarding the scope

As is apparent from point 59 of the Advocate General’s Opinion, that State has a connection with the family situation of the creditor and the debtor, at least in so far as the possibilities of the satisfaction of the creditor’s needs by the debtor are concerned. The predictability of that law is also attributable to the fact that it is dependent on the jurisdiction of the court chosen, which in the present case coincides with the jurisdiction under the traditional rule that the claimant must bring his action before the court of the defendant.</p>

In such a situation, the law of the forum, Austrian law in the present case, could apply if the maintenance creditor were to be ‘unable … to obtain maintenance’ under the law of the State of his habitual residence during a period in the past such as that at issue in the main proceedings, that being German law in the present case.
