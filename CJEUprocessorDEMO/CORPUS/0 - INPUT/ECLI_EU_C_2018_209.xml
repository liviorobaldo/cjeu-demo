In accordance with that objective, Article 1(4) of Directive 97/9 defines the term ‘investor’ broadly as any person who has entrusted money or instruments to such a firm in connection with investment business. Likewise, recital 8 of the directive refers, generally, to ‘money and instruments held by an investment firm in connection with an investor’s investment operations’.</p>

          In the present instance, it should be recalled, first, that the funds upon which Ms Anisimovienė and Others and Mr Raišelis base their claims were no longer credited to the accounts held by those individuals with Snoras on the day when deposits in it became unavailable. Second, the future transferable securities to which they had subscribed and of which that credit institution was to be the issuer were ultimately not issued before it was declared insolvent. In addition, as regards those transferable securities, whilst the bonds at issue in Case C‑109/16 are among the ‘debts evidenced by a certificate’ envisaged in Article 1(1) of Directive 94/19, the shares at issue in Case C‑688/15, on the other hand, are equity securities, with respect to which that directive provides no guarantee (judgment of 21 December 2016, Vervloet and Others,

          ), the Court held that the provisions of Directive 97/9 relating to delimitation of the funds and instruments covered by the compensation schemes for which it provides, including Article 1(4) and the second subparagraph of Article 2(2), are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be capable of being relied on directly by individuals before the national courts.
