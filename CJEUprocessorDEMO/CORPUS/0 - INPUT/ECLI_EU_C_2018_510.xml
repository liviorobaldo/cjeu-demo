Consequently, the finding by the General Court in paragraph 22 of the order under appeal, that ‘INEA is the author of the contested act, being the email of 17 July 2015, which was adopted by virtue of the powers delegated by the Commission ....[and] it has not been established that the Commission was associated with the email’ is wrong.</p>

          According to settled case-law, it follows from the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) and Article 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice that an appeal must indicate precisely the contested elements of the decision of the General Court under appeal and the legal arguments specifically advanced in support of the appeal. An appeal which merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the General Court, including those based on facts expressly rejected by the General Court, does not satisfy the requirement to state reasons under those provisions (judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council,

        <p class="normal">As recalled in paragraph 26 of this judgment, the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission was based on two absolute bars to proceeding, alleging that, first, the email of 17 July 2015 was a preparatory act and was not therefore open to judicial challenge and, second, the action brought by Spliethoff could not be directed against the Commission who was not the author of that email.</p>

According to Spliethoff, the subject matter of the proceedings was in fact the definitive decision by which the Commission rejected its proposal.</p>

        <p class="normal">The General Court rejected that argument by ruling, in paragraphs 23 and 36 of the order under appeal, that even if INEA was responsible for notifying the Commission’s decision and did not itself have the power to adopt grant decisions under the CEF, the procedure for the adoption, by the Commission, of a decision on the selection and award of grants was, at the date of the email of 17 July 2015 still under way, with the result that that email could not be interpreted as meaning that the Commission had already taken the decision to dismiss certain proposals, including Spliethoff’s proposal.</p>

It is true that INEA clarified that the procedure leading to the adoption of the Commission decision on the selection of projects and the award of grants was still under way. However, it added that ‘in the unlikely case that the adoption of this decision results in changes in relation to your proposal, you will be informed separately by email’. Spliethoff did not subsequently receive any other email from INEA or the Commission in that regard.</p>

It is common ground that that decision was only published on the website of the DG for Mobility and Transport and that of INEA on 12 and 14 October 2015 respectively and that, moreover and contrary to the requirements stemming from the principle of sound administration, that decision was not, at any time, the subject of a notification to Spliethoff.</p>
