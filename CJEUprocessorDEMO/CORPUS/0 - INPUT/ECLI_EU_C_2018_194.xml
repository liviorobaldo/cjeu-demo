In that regard, the Republic of Austria disputes the Commission’s argument that only individual interests are at issue here since, according to that Member State, interference with such data should, on the contrary, be regarded as being, in particular in the context of the fight against terrorism, a threat to internal public security and accordingly should be prevented by all possible means.</p>
