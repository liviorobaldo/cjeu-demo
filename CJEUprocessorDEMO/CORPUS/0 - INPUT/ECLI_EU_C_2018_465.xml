        <p class="normal">Secondly, neither Article 3(2) of Directive 2008/115 nor any other provision of that directive makes the illegality of the stay dependent on the outcome of an appeal against an administrative decision on the ending of a legal stay or on the absence of an authorisation to remain pending the outcome of such an appeal. On the contrary, whereas, as noted in paragraph 40 of the present judgment, it is clear from a combined reading of Article 7(1) of Directive 2005/85 and recital 9 of Directive 2008/115 that the right of an applicant for international protection to remain on the territory of the Member State concerned, during the period from submission of the application until adoption of a first instance decision on that application, acts to prevent the concerned person’s stay from being regarded as ‘illegal’, within the meaning of Directive 2008/115, during that period; on the contrary, no provision or recital of Directive 2005/85 or of Directive 2008/115 provides that an authorisation to remain on the territory until resolution of an appeal against the rejection acts, in itself, to prevent that stay from being regarded as ‘illegal’.</p>

        <p class="normal">Thirdly, Directive 2008/115 is not based on the notion that the illegality of the stay and, accordingly, the applicability of that directive, presupposes that there is no lawful possibility for the third-country national to remain on the territory of the Member State concerned, inter alia pending the outcome of the appeal against the decision on the ending of a legal stay. On the contrary, as is apparent from recital 12, that directive is applicable to third-country nationals whose stay is classified as illegal, but who are permitted to remain lawfully on the territory of the Member State concerned because they cannot yet be removed. In particular, Article 7 of that directive requires the setting of an appropriate period for voluntary departure of the person concerned, during which, despite his stay being classified as illegal, he is authorised to remain. Moreover, pursuant to Article 5 and Article 9(1) of that directive, Member States are required to respect the principle of non-refoulement in relation to illegally staying third-country nationals and to postpone their removal when it would violate that principle.</p>

The possibility of aggregating those two decisions in a single administrative act enables Member States to ensure the parallel treatment, or even the joint handling, of the administrative proceedings leading to such decisions and of the appeal proceedings brought against them. As observed by the Czech, German and Netherlands Governments, that possibility of joint handling also helps overcome practical difficulties relating to the notification of return decisions.</p>

Subject to strict compliance with that requirement, the sole fact that the stay of the person concerned is categorised as being illegal, within the meaning of Directive 2008/115, as soon as his application for international protection is rejected at first instance by the determining authority and that a return decision may, therefore, be adopted after that rejection decision or aggregated together in a single administrative act, does not infringe the principle of non-refoulement or the right to an effective remedy.</p>

Article 6(6) of that directive explicitly lays down that requirement in the case where a return decision is adopted at the same time as the decision at first instance, from the determining authority, rejecting the application for international protection. That requirement must also apply in a situation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the return decision was adopted immediately after the decision rejecting the application for international protection, in a separate administrative act and by a different authority.</p>

          Furthermore, pending the outcome of an appeal against the rejection of his application for international protection at first instance by the determining authority, the person concerned must, in principle, be entitled to benefit from the rights arising under Directive 2003/9. Article 3(1) of that directive makes its application conditional only on the existence of an authorisation to remain on the territory as an applicant and, therefore, does not exclude the directive’s application in the case where the person concerned has such an authorisation and is staying illegally, within the meaning of Directive 2008/115. In that regard, it is apparent from Article 2(c) of Directive 2003/9 that the person concerned is to retain his status as an applicant for international protection, within the meaning of that directive, until a final decision is adopted in relation to his application (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 September 2012, Cimade and GISTI,
