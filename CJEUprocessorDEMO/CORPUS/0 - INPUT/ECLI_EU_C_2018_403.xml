          Such a finding cannot be called in question by the objection raised by the Belgian Government relating to the general nature of the regulations at issue in the main proceedings. Indeed, besides the fact that it is apparent from the actual wording of the first indent of Article 2(a) of the SEA Directive that the notion of ‘plans and programmes’ can cover normative acts adopted by law or regulation, that directive does not contain any special provisions in relation to policies or general legislation that would call for them to be distinguished from plans and programmes for the purpose of that directive. Moreover, the fact that RZTPRs, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, contain general rules, express some abstract ideas, and pursue an objective of transforming an area is illustrative of their planning and programming aspect and does not prevent them from being included in the definition of ‘plans and programmes’ (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 October 2016, D’Oultremont and Others,

          It should be borne in mind that the fundamental objective of the SEA Directive is to ensure that ‘plans and programmes’ which are likely to have significant effects on the environment are subject to an environmental assessment when they are prepared and prior to their adoption (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 February 2012, Inter-Environnement Wallonie and Terre wallonne,
