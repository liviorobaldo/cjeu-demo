First, the Council and the Commission adopted those regulations without assessing beforehand the market economy treatment claims lodged by certain exporting producers that were the subject of the investigation at the origin of those regulations, in breach of Article 2(7)(b) of Regulation No 384/96. Second, the Council and the Commission omitted, in breach of Article 9(5) of Regulation No 384/96, to assess the individual treatment claims from those same exporting producers.</p>
