# The CJEUprocessorDEMO
<p style="text-align:justify">
A demo processing case law of the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) via <a href="http://www.liviorobaldo.com/sdftagger.html">SDFTagger</a> is available for download, under the GNU Lesser General Public License. The demo includes both the source code and the corpus (635 html files publicly available on the CJEU website, which have been downloaded).

<p style="text-align:justify">
The SDFTagger library is included in the source files of the demo, please locate the homonym subfolder.

I developed the demo with Netbeans IDE 8.2, thus I've uploaded the whole Netbeans project folder, in order to facilitate Netbeans users. If you don't use Netbeans, please extract the source files and recompile them in your editor. Note also that the 
<a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">Stanford CoreNLP</a> does not work well with Java 12 (at least on my pc). You should instead execute it on <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">Java 8</a>.

A description of the SDFTagger library, together with a User Manual, is available on <a href="http://www.liviorobaldo.com/sdftagger.html">My Website</a>.
